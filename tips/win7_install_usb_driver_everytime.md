###Windows 7 always search and install driver when new device plugin

After install a Windows 7 on my laptop in office, i found usb device is not available. When i plugin a usb card, usb keyboard, usb mouse, win7 always try to find a driver for the usb device, but after it install the driver, those usb device still stay unresponsive.
I tried to reinstall usb driver from device management, but problem cannot fix.
Solution from [1] solved this problem.
I should update driver from "C:/Windows/System32/DriveStore/FileRepository/"!
