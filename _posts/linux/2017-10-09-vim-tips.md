### make a increased number by line in vim

I need to create some lines which contains a sequence of increased number line by line.

#### Way 0:
```sh
seq -f %1.f 978711100001 978711130000 >num.txt
```
#### Way 1:
```sh
In vim's command mode, input "r !seq 1 12".
:r !seq 1 10
cat t
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```
#### Way 2:
```sh
#!/bin/sh

for ((i=100001;i<=130000;i++))
do
   echo "978711$i">>/tmp/num.txt
done
```

#### Way 3:
- copy lines with same number, eg "1"
```sh
cat t
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
```

- In vim's command mode, input "let i=0 | g/**1**/s//\=i/ | let i=i+1" . "**1**" is the number you copied to every line.

```sh
:let i=0 | g/1/s//\=i/ | let i=i+1
// After that command, you will get number you needed
cat t
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

```
- Our target is <vcpupin vcpu='0' cpuset='0' />
Record an action, change "0" to "0 0", and repeat that action. like:
```sh
cat t 
0 0
1 1
......
12 12
```
Recoard an action, change "0 0" to "\<vcpupin vcpu='0' cpuset='0' /\>" and repeat that action.
```sh
cat t 
<vcpupin vcpu='0' cpuset='0' />
......
<vcpupin vcpu='12' cpuset='12' />
```


#### Way 4:

插入模式下，按顺序输入 ctrl-r，=，range(1,100)，回车
